            title: "Healthy Soil",
            description: "It all begins with soil. Achieving healthy soil starts with a soil test, and I recommend getting that test from a lab that does Albrecht method soil balancing. Unlike your local extension agent (where you can also get a test), these labs tell you which minerals your soil lacks in the root zone. It also reveals your soil’s organic matter. Apply compost and the minerals the lab suggests at the rates the test specifies for the highest yield. Also consider some amount of compost tea or extract to add the microbial life that’s needed."

            title: "Good Bed Preparation",
            description: "If you plan to till, do not till when it is too wet. If the soil smears between your fingers instead of gently crumbling, that is too wet. Also consider no-till gardening. You can do this by adding thick layers of mulch to a bed and allowing several months for it to break down. If you don’t have that amount of time, try adding a thick layer of compost and planting directly into that."

            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/fresh_seed.jpg"),
            title: "Fresh Seed",
            description: "It is always tempting to use old seed, but unless it’s kept in ideal conditions, old seed has probably lost some of its germination rate and might not perform as well for you."
        },
        {
            id:3,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/healthy_transplant.jpg"),
            title: "Healthy Transplant",
            description: "When using transplants, make sure the crop is healthy and vigorous before putting it in the soil. Adding a weak crop to the soil can lead to disease and pest issues."
        },
        {
            id:4,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/variety.jpg"),
            title: "The Right Variety",
            description: "Wherever you are and whenever you plan to grow the crop, find varieties that match your climate or at least your heat or cold. If you live in a colder climate, look for cold-hardy varieties. In hotter climates, or for summer crops, look for those slow to bolt or ones that can handle the heat—whatever your average heat might be."

        {
            id:5,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/establishment.png"),
            title: "Proper Establishment",
            description: "Once the crops hit the soil, it’s important to make sure that they get established well. The block of soil should be covered completely so as to not dry out. Irrigate if conditions are dry. Immediately apply any sort of frost or pest protection."

            id:6,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/weed_management.jpg"),
            title: "Weed Management",
            description: "Weeds can quickly smother and outcompete crops, making them unproductive or difficult to harvest. So managing weeds becomes a critical step in having a successful crop of any sort. Not tilling helps, as does regular garden cultivation. If you address weeds from the very beginning, before there is an issue, they will always be easier to manage, which will lead to a more successful crop."

            id:7,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/moisture.gif"),
            title: "Good Moisture",
            description: "You can keep the crop in moist soil many different ways, but doing so is necessary for the success of most crops. Some crops are drought tolerant, but crops live off the microbial activity below them, and the microbes need water. Keep the soil covered to preserve moisture and consider some amount of irrigation."

        {
            id:8,
            img_path: require("../components/assets/tipsImages/pest.jpg"),
            title: "Pest Protection",
            description: "The biggest issue most crops face in terms of pests do not come from the soil, but rather they fly in (or walk in, as the case might be for deer). So making sure the susceptible crops are safe is a great way to ensure the crop’s success. Cover crops such as arugula and spring brassicas with row cover varieties that are sensitive to pest damage. Putting some amount of perimeter protection for your bigger pests (deer, hogs, and so on) might also be essential in some areas."
